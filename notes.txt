Proposed Experimental Design
- Research question
     - independent variable: touch input surface
     - dependent variables: time and accuracy on selection and scrolling tasks
     - is scrolling and selection faster and more accurate on a touch wristband than on a regular touchscreen watch
- apparatus
     - smartwatch with arduino touch sensors (watch screen will probably be simulated on an android phone)
- participants
     - 12 volunteers, 6 male, 6 female
- experimental design
     - app, 6 do touchband first, 6 smartwatch first, mix up selection and scrolling tasks
- tasks and procedures
     - scrolling test - find an item in a long list
     - selection test - select one of 4 colored blocks, then one of 9, then 16
- measures
     - speed and accuracy for each task
     - subjective survey at the end, which input method did the participant prefer for each task?
- data collection
     - will be coded into the app - time and accuracy measures for each trial
     - paper survey at the end

To Do:
Shamama - see what kinds of touch sensors you have
Serena - buy a chunky watchband
Dina - start working on experimental design write-up
everyone - get set up with Android Studio
