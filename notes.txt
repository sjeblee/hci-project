Proposed Experimental Design
- Research question
     - independent variable: touch input surface
     - dependent variables: time and accuracy on selection and scrolling tasks
     - is scrolling and selection faster and more accurate on a touch wristband than on a regular touchscreen watch
- apparatus
     - smartwatch with arduino touch sensors (watch screen will probably be simulated on an android phone)
- participants
     - 12 volunteers, 6 male, 6 female
- experimental design
     - app, 6 do touchband first, 6 smartwatch first, mix up selection and scrolling tasks
- tasks and procedures
     - scrolling test - find an item in a long list
     - selection test - select one of 4 colored blocks, then one of 9, then 16
- measures
     - speed and accuracy for each task
     - subjective survey at the end, which input method did the participant prefer for each task?
- data collection
     - will be coded into the app - time and accuracy measures for each trial
     - paper survey at the end

To Do:
Shamama - see what kinds of touch sensors you have
Serena - buy a chunky watchband
Dina - start working on experimental design write-up
everyone - get set up with Android Studio

- Shamama - sensors and app integration
- Serena - app metrics and structure
- Gurleen - app GUI
- Dina - writing

App structure
- Start screen - New session
- Task screen - Scrolling, selection, finish
- scrolling start screen - item to find and start button
     - long list of items, goal item placed randomly somewhere in the second half
- selection start screen - select the black square, start button
     - 4 colored blocks, 1 black, randomly arranged
- finish screen - show participant number

03-06-17
- need to filter out people with significant smartwatch experience
- think about reducing the number of independent variables
- touch target example
     - direct manipulation is inherently faster
     - have them use arrows on the screen to navigate with a cursor
     - look at Fitt's law procedures and how to calculate accuracy
     - maybe have a notification dismissal task instead
- apparatus - mention that arduino is connected to a laptop with a server
- 5166 Bahen Center at 2pm on Wed
     
Shamama - Instructions, consent forms, and hardware

Notes from pilot study
- Make sure we explain why we're doing this study and exactly what the task is
- Maybe add a question to the post-experiment survey about how intuitive they thought the touch interface was

- If we can fix everything by Monday afternoon, we should run as many people as possible

TODO:
Shamama - Try to make the network faster or transfer data directly from arduino to watch via usb
Gurleen - Finish the zooming activity, remove the border around the square, and add metrics
Serena - Make the target item bigger, make the list items smaller, try to optimize scrolling speed
Dina - poster and paper draft
